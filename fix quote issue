# Parser for Arithmetic Operations in Marathi Language

This is a parser built in JavaScript that can parse arithmetic operations written in Marathi language, which is an Indian language. It follows the BODMAS (Bracket, Order, Division and Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) rule to evaluate expressions. The parser can handle input strings that include Marathi words for division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction operations, as well as decimals, brackets, and whitespace. Notably, this parser does not use any built-in parsing mechanisms such as the `eval()` method.
